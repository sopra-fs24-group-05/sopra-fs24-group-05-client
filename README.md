# Sopra 24 - Rank Everything Server - by Group 5

## Project Description

"Rank Everything" is an innovative digital application that empowers users to create and participate in topics for collective ranking. This application allows users to create items within these topics, assign points based on their preferences, and visualize rankings in real-time. It also facilitates rich user interaction through the ability to comment on items and engage with comments via replies and likes, ensuring a vibrant community dialogue around each ranked item.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Internet connection
- JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-05/sopra-fs24-group-05-client.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Building with Gradle

You can use the local Gradle Wrapper to build the application.

- macOS: `./gradlew`
- Linux: `./gradlew`
- Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

### Build

```
./gradlew build
```

### Run

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

You can verify that the server is running by visiting `localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Test

```
./gradlew test
```

### Development Mode

You can start the backend in development mode, this will automatically trigger a new build and reload the application once the content of a file has been changed.

Start two terminal windows and run

```
./gradlew build --continuous
```

and in the other one:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:

```
./gradlew build --continuous -xtest
```
